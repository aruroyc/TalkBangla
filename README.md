An exploration of different implementations for Speech Recognition using a open dataset for Bengali

This project is a proof of concept project as a way to understand the features and architectures that are used to design an Automatic Speech Recognition system.
It uses a Bengali dataset with creative commons license from https://bengali.ai/datasets/


To achieve this we will attempt the following:
* Feature extraction. (DONE - MFCC was chosen as the feature of choice)
* Network design.(DONE - A basic deep RNN was designed for the network)
* Training. (INPROGRESS)
* Validation. (TODO)
* Running inference on stored sound files (flac/wav). (TODO)
* Running inference on streaming sound data. (STRETCH/TODO)
